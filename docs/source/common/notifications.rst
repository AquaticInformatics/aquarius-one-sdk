Notification APIs
====

A publisher - subscriber notification system that allows applications to register topics with associated templates for each type of delivery method such as email, 
in-app notifications and mobile push notifications. 
The notification service is activated when another service or application sends it an event with data associated to a topic. 
This event is then routed to intended recipients that have chosen to receive this notification through their preferences with the appropriate delivery method. 
This service is also fully localized.
