Digital Twins
====

Enterprise Twin are digital twins that provide multiple essential purposes including: Organizational Modelling and Security, Resource-Based Access Control, physical world modelling, Instrument relations with Telemetry, and Data Cataloguing through Telemetry Twins.

Digital Twins are classified through a Category (Organizational, Spatial, Instrument and Telemetry) and then by a Type and then by a Sub-Type.

Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL) is leveraged to describe data schemas that unleash the power of the data stored within the Digital Twins.

Digital twin is the phrase used to describe a computerized (or digital) version of a physical asset and/or process. 

Digital Twins are an industry concept

- There are different implementation of the concept with each vendor
- AQI has implemented it’s own Digital Twins to
   - Optimize for cost and performance
   - Optimize for specific Water Quality needs

Provides Data about Physical Counterpart
-----------

This data can be used to model the "Real World" by recording attributes of the physical world.

Hierarchical Context
^^^^^^^

Often applications will use a hierarchical view to organize data and systems such as Spatial Graphs for Treatment Plants

Geospatial Context
^^^^^^^

Virtual Items represent items in a “Physical World”
- Where is the item?
- To whom does the digital twin belong?
